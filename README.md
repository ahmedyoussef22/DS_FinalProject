**Purpose:** To complete a full data science project that benefits society

**Specification:**
This major project in data science is about two things: executing a full data science study,
similar to ones we have seen throughout the course; and determining where a data science
approach can be beneficial to a societal need or movement.

Needless to say, this second part is somewhat vague. What I am looking for is some
question that can be answered through the power of data that can help a community of
people better themselves. This can be as broad or as narrow as you’d like. I’d recommend
taking a look at the various studies posted by the Data Science for Social Good group at
the University of Chicago (https://dssg.uchicago.edu/) for general ideas of what I’m
looking for. From there your team should look at the various data sets available to you at
the link posted on the course website and identify a broad category (i.e. weather, politics,
etc.) that you’d like to explore. You may also attempt a current competition available
through Kaggle’s Data Science for Good (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). NOTE:
there are a lot of Kaggle competitions, only the Data Science for Good ones are
automatically eligible. 

**Question Proposal:**
Your team will need to narrow down a central question you plan on
exploring very early on in the process. Once you have established your question, you
should prepare a one-page paper detailing your question and its relevance to a societal
need. You should also include what data set you’ll be using and any citations you need to
make your team’s case. Note: citations are not necessary, but your team’s argument for
societal need may be rejected due to lack of evidence and your team will have to redo the
paper (with a grade penalty). 

**Data:**
Once your team’s question has been approved, you should start to clean up your
data and do your data analysis. There is no specific turnin for this (other than notification
of the data set selected via email) but you should include information about how you
formatted your data and your data analysis in the final paper (see below). Once you have
clean data, you should create whatever models you need to answer the question you have
chosen in Python, using whatever third-party modules you need. There is no restriction
beyond the language for your programs. 

**Final Paper**
In addition to your team’s code, there will be a final paper documenting
your team’s process. The first page of this is your justification paper, but the remaining
parts of the paper should include information about: how your approach or the question is
unique; what data and conclusions are already available; how the data has been altered
(cleaned); what inferences you were able to make during the data analysis portion of the
project; what successes and failures you had during the model creation process; what 
conclusions you are able to make in reference to your question; and what future work is
available in further exploration of your question. Including appropriate diagrams of
appropriate size (but not including any significant amount of code, or the required
bibliography, title, and abstract), this should be at least 10 pages, single-spaced with 1”
margins, 12pt Times New Roman font, no excessive spacing, and you should have at
least 10 in-line cited sources. You may use MLA, Chicago, or AMS citation styles. 

Be very careful to pay attention to all deadlines noted below. There will be no allowances
for late turnins, including slip days. Also be sure to read and understand the rubrics
associated with the various portions of this project (also below). 

**Team Organization**
Your team must select one member of your group to be the team lead. This person will be
in charge of communicating with me at various points during the remainder of the
semester as well as creating and maintaining the github repository. 

**Github Use**
Github is required for storing and updating your code, paper, and presentations. Each
member must do their own pull requests (you are not allowed to have a central person
handling all changes). This is done for two reasons: to make sure everyone gets
experience using a source control mechanism and to make sure that everyone is
contributing equally. We will be dedicating a class to the ins and outs of github and git. 

NOTE: You will likely not be able to store your data files on github due to their
requirement that every file be <100MB in size. A Dropbox or Google Drive link will be
sufficient for distribution of your data. 

**Presentation**
During the final class you and your team will be giving a professional, 20 minute
presentation on your question, methodology, and results. Your presentation must include
the following components: 

* Your team’s question and the motivation for answering said question
* Establishing what results are already available
* Your team’s methodology, including justification for the methodology
* Your results delivered in a clear, concise manner
* What the next steps in this project would be 

Presentations will be evaluated by the instructor and the class. You will be evaluated on
clarity, content, ability to answer questions, presentation ability (this includes being able
to deliver a clean, well-rehearsed lecture, with appropriate body language, and no
technical hiccups), and professional appearance (both attire and slides). After the
presentation, there will be a 5-minute Q&A session. 

**Individual Rubric for Presentation:**
```
35% - Class average evaluation
35% - Instructor average evaluation
10% - Duration
10% - Discussion of all required components
10% - Even distribution of speaking across all members of the team
```


**Deductions:**
```
-25 presentation slides not in correct format/turned in on time
-25 substantive changes to presentation slides after deadline
-100 not participating in the presentation 
```

**Deliverables:**
Justification paper – by the deadline listed below, your team leader should email me your
justification paper in docx or pdf format. 

Project code + data – by the deadline listed below, you will need to finalize your project
code and README.md file in github. You will also need to send me a link to your clean
data so that I can reliably run your project. Your README.md file needs to include the
following information: 

* Project title
* Team member list
* Project abstract (250-500 words)
* Target language and version
* List of any additional packages required with installation instructions 

Project paper – by the deadline listed below, you will need to finalize your paper in docx
or pdf format in github.

Presentation slides – your presentation slides will be posted to github and cloned after the
deadline noted below and should be in either pptx or pdf. You are allowed to make minor
changes, but substantive changes in the slides will result in a deduction. 

Team member reviews – by the deadline listed below, each team member should send me
an email containing a numeric (0-100) grade for each of the other team members
complete with justification.

**Due Dates:**
```
All team submission emails should come from the team leads.
3/21, 5pm - Link to the github page for your project via email 
3/28, 5pm – Selection notification of data set(s) via email
4/7, 5pm – Selection of question to be answered, justification paper via email
4/24, 5pm – Final clone of the github repository for all code and the final paper
4/24, 5pm – Link for the clean dataset(s) via email or dataset available via github
4/24, 11:59pm – Team member reviews via email
4/24, 11:59pm – Presentation slides final clone
4/25, 2pm – Final presentations 
```
**Individual Rubric:**
```
25% - team evaluations
35% - code and model correctness
25% - final paper (content, length, grammar, and citations)
15% - successful completion of early deadlines
```

**Deductions:**
```
